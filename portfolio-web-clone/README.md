# Portfolio Website Clone

This repository contains a cloned version of a portfolio website design created in Figma. The project was implemented using HTML and CSS, focusing on learning outcomes related to structuring website layouts, CSS, and utilizing the flex property for responsive designs.

## Project Description

The objective of this project was to clone a portfolio website design from Figma and replicate it as a functional website using HTML and CSS. The Figma design served as a visual reference for the layout, styling, and overall aesthetics of the website. By carefully examining the design, I aimed to gain a deeper understanding of structuring website layouts, implementing CSS styles, and effectively utilizing the flex property for responsive designs.

## Features

- Cloned the portfolio website design from Figma.
- Created a structured layout using HTML, ensuring appropriate sections, headers, and footers.
- Implemented CSS styles to match the design, including fonts, colors, and spacing.
- Utilized the flex property of CSS for responsive layouts.

## Learning Outcomes

Throughout the development of this project, I achieved the following learning outcomes:

1. **Structuring Website Layouts:** By cloning the portfolio website design, I gained hands-on experience in structuring the layout of a website using HTML. This involved creating logical sections, organizing content, and utilizing semantic HTML elements for improved accessibility.

2. **CSS Styling:** I improved my CSS skills by applying various styles to match the design. This included selecting appropriate fonts, colors, and spacing to ensure visual consistency with the original Figma design.

3. **Responsive Design with Flex Property:** Implementing the flex property of CSS allowed me to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. By using flexbox techniques, I learned how to build flexible and responsive designs, enabling the website to look and function optimally across various devices.

## Usage

To view the cloned portfolio website, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The website should render with the replicated design and layout.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the original designer of the portfolio website for their inspiring Figma design, which served as the basis for this project. Additionally, I extend my gratitude to the online resources and tutorials that provided guidance and insights into HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques.
